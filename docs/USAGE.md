# Overview

Avocado is a mixture of Ruby modules that you include into your own application
classes and Ruby classes which will run directly from the gem. The classes are
intended to provide good defaults for basic scenarios, and can be subclassed and
overridden for special cases beyond the basics.

## Requirements

You must be running Rails 7.1 or newer within your application. The gem uses
some Rails features (`authenticate_by`, `has_secure_password`,
`generates_token_for`, `normalizes`, etc) which don't exist in earlier versions.

You should have a database schema with columns that match the `users`,
`sessions`, and `events` tables from the [demo app schema]. It's ok to have more
columns in each table, but you need at least what is shown there. Slight
variations (using `uuid` instead of `bigint` for example) are harmless, but
large departures will break the integration.

Your application must also have:

- An `ApplicationController` base controller class
- An `ApplicationMailer` base mailer class
- A `root_path` method (usually generated by routes)

## Usage

Once those requirements are met, include the modules into your models:

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  include Avocado::User
end

class Session < ApplicationRecord
  include Avocado::Session
end

class Event < ApplicationRecord
  include Avocado::Event
end
```

This will set up some basic validations, associations, normalizations, and
callbacks for those models.

You also need to add a module to your top-level controller:

```ruby
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  include Avocado::Authentication
end
```

## Summary

### Routable controller features

The gem will create RESTful routes that go to the various controllers during app
initialization. By default, these external (unauthenticated) features are
available:

- `Registrations` -- Fill out new form and create users
- `Sessions` -- Sign in and sign out features
- `Recoveries` -- Trigger password reset, click link, confirm
- `Verifications` -- Email confirmation on account creation or email change
- `Affirmations` -- Provides a "passwordless" auth via emailed link

These internal (authenticated) features are available:

- `Sessions` -- List active sessions, click to destroy untrusted ones
- `Events` -- List view of user activity audit log
- `Passwords` -- Edit and update user password
- `Emails` -- Edit and update user email

Linking to any of these internal pages is optional. You can use them as-is,
override their views, or even ignore them entirely and make your own versions.

### Mailers

There is an `Avocado::Mailer` which gets called to send emails. The mailer views
here are very basic, and should be overriden within applications. You can place
views within `app/views/avocado/mailer/` to make this happen.

### Before actions

There is an `authenticate` method installed as a default `before_action`. Any
actions which do not need to be authenticated should disable this.

There is a `set_current_request_details` method installed as a default
`before_action` which takes some potentially loggable request meta information
(user agent, IP address) and sets its value in `Current` so that its accesible
to code elsewhere in the gem. This could also be opted out of if not desirable.

### Helpers

The `Avocado::Authentication` module included into the application controller
provides some helper methods available in controllers, views, and helpers:

- `signed_in?` is true if the session has a signed in user
- `current_session` provides the DB record for the session, if one exists
- `current_user` returns the user belonging to that session

## Customization

There is currently not any explicit configuration ability. To override
functionality, you can:

- Redefine a method created in one of the models by the included module
- Subclass a controller and update the routing to go to your subclass
- Place views in your app where avocado expects them to override the defaults

## Examples

There is a [demo app] used by the specs which has some example usage.
